            “In 50-150 words, create a poem about a queen that smokes” ChatGPT, June 2, 2025,
            https://chat.openai.com.<br />
            The poem generated by ChatGPT inspired me to create artwork that explores the hidden vulnerabilities of a
            queen.<br />
            Often times we think of royalty as a powerful figure someone flawless or untouchable.<br />
            <br />
            I was struck by the idea that even a queen is susceptible to the ordinary struggles of life. <br />
            The foundation of the artwork: portraying royal elegance with subtle signs of emotional burden, human flaws,
            and moral complexity. <br />
            I wanted to 'draw back the curtains' and reveal the illusion of perfection and elevate the truth that
            nobility does not exempt one from the human experience. <br />
            Even in leadership, strength and imperfection can coexist, even under a crown.<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The following is the poem in its entirety: <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            In marble halls where shadows sprawl,<br />
            The queen sits still, beneath it all.<br />
            A cigarette between pale lips,<br />
            Her sorrow drips in slow eclipse.<br />
            <br />
            <br />

            Black crows perch on the window frame,<br />
            They caw her sins, they speak her name.<br />
            Their feathers gleam like onyx night— <br />
            They watch her fall without a fight.<br />
            <br />
            <br />

            Her crown lies dull upon her hair,<br />
            A fading echo of despair.<br />
            The smoke curls up, a ghostly thread,<br />
            Of broken dreams and lovers fled.<br />
            <br />
            <br />

            She speaks to no one, barely breathes,<br />
            Just listens as the black crow grieves.<br />
            A court of ash, a throne of sighs,<br />
            With wingbeats cutting through her lies.<br />
            <br />
            <br />

            No diamonds flash, no scepter sways—<br />
            Just nicotine and darker days.<br />
            A queen undone, a world grown cold,<br />
            While black crows circle, brave and bold.
