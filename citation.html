        <p>
            The Will is a story about a young girl who inherited a wooden trunk filled with family belongings and an
            entire camera collection left to her by her grandfather.<br />
            She becomes interested in the cameras and how they function. After she developed the photos, an unexpected
            occurrence happened... the pictures were from the past, but who are these people?<br />
            She later learns that the people in the photos were her ancestors.
